# Safari Extension: Google Search If Site Search Has No Results

## What is it?
**This Safari extension detects when a website search returns no results. It then adds a link to Google for the same search query.**

This is helpful, because when you are not using the perfect keywords, Google is way better at selecting what you are searching than any search engine of a website.  
Sometimes, only mixing up two letters prevents any search results to show up.


Without the extension, the search `sort hgue array` on Stackoverflow.com will only display the not very helpful: `Your search returned no matches.`:

With the extension, a link to Google will be added:

The Google search is configured with the same keywords used on the local search, and is limited to the original site domain (using the filter `site:domain.com`).

## How to add support for an other website

- Fork this project

- Add the domain of your website to the 'Allowed Domains' list.  
For example: `*.stackoverflow.com`  
![Screenshot example](./documentation_images/New_Domain_Pattern_In_Allowed_Domains.png)  
This tell Safari to load this extension when visiting the host name.
    
- Add a New URL Pattern to the Whitelist to whitelist the search pages.  
For example: `http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=*`  
![Screenshot example](./documentation_images/New_URL_Pattern_In_Injected_Extension_Content_Whitelist.png)  
This tell Safari to only load this extension when visiting a search page  
*Note that as per the documentation, the wildcard * can not be used in the scheme.*  
**BUG: As per my testing, the whitelist does not work as expected. Ie, only having this in the whitelist: `http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=*`, the extension is still loaded on `stackoverflow.com` or `http://stackoverflow.com/tags`.**

- Implement the 3 functions to search and manipulate the DOM tree:  
  detect if user is visiting a search result page with no results found: `is_a_search_page_with_no_results_DOMAIN()`,  
  get the keywords of the search query: `text_of_search_query_DOMAIN()`,  
  get the insertion place for the new node: `node_where_to_append_new_node_as_a_child_DOMAIN()`

- Test it.  
To reload the extension, use Extension Builder (via Safari's Menu Bar: Develop > Show Extension Builder).
If you don't have a Safari Developer Certificate, get one or test by copying and pasting your js code in the console
